Introduction to React & WordPress,https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Montclair-Meetup/,"React is a modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In WordPress, it is what powers Gutenberg. In this presentation, we will cover the basics of React and how it works. We'll chat about things like components, state, making API calls, and how components can communicate with each other. We will also touch on things you might already know in WordPress that complement React, like the wp_localize_script function and the WordPress REST API. We'll then take a look at Gutenberg and how it extends React with its blocks and panels.As an example, we will show off some of GatherPress, an open source, WordPress-powered project for creating events that is using Gutenberg in the admin and React on the frontend.---Mike Auteri (@mauteri) is a Senior Software Engineer at Penske Media Corporation (PMC) who leads development for many well-known publishing brands on WordPress.com VIP. He's contributed a few lines of code to WordPress core, written a couple plugins, presented at meetups/WordCamps, and is a co-organizer of the WordPress Montclair Meetup and lead organizer of WordCamp Montclair 2020.
